Experimenting with gravity, ships, planets and lasers as part of a
larger project.

Ships flock after and attack weaker ones of different colours

Ships have shields to protect from laser fire. Shelds get smaller when
hit. No shield means certain death.

Planets attract ships. Ships fly perpendicular to planets to avoid
them, this results in a slingshot effect.

Ships scale visually to show velocity.
